# Hangman-Game

Overview

Create a computer game that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML powered by JavaScript code. 

Choose a creative theme for the game. 

Use key events to listen for the letters that players will type.

Try to display the following on the page: 

    - Press any key to get started!

    - Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

    - If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.

    - As the user guesses the correct letters, the letters are revealed: m a d o _ _ a.

    - Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

    - Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).


After the user wins/loses, the game will automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
